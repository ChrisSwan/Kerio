Kerio Python Library
====================

Kerio provides a PHP library to talk to the administration-API of Kerio
Connect, but we needed a Python library to import Gmail contacts into Kerio
Connect. So we created the Python library.

This library allows you to talk to both the administration API and the webmail
API (so you can do stuff as the user that needs things). Usage is pretty
straight forward, if you ask me. A small example is included. To know what you
need to send to the API, check the commands that your browser sends.

To get more info on transferring Gmail contacts to Kerio Connect, contact me.

Feel free to fork this library and improve it!
